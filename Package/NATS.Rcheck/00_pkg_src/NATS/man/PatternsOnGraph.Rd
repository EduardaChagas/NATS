\title{Time-series plot with starting points of the given pattern}
\usage{
PatternsOnGraph(series, dimension, delay, number.pattern)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{A numeric vector (e.g. a time series)}

\item{dimension}{Dimension size of ordinal patterns}

\item{delay}{Size of the embedding delay of ordinal patterns}

\item{number.pattern}{Pattern that should have its starting point analyzed on the time-series graph.  The indices of the patterns followed are done by ordering the positions of the groups in chronological order (Permutation of Classification)}
}
\value{
A plot with time-series and starting points of the given pattern
}
\description{
Time-series plot with starting points of the given pattern
}
\examples{
set.seed(123, kind = "Mersenne-Twister")
x <- runif(10000)
d <- 3
del <- 1
n = 1
p <- PatternsOnGraph(series = x, dimension = d, delay = del, number.pattern = n)
print(p)
