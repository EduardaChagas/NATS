  <div class="intro" id="igoal">

  	<p>NATS (Non-parametric Analysis Time Series) is a portable, fast and good numerical quality tool that enables interactive and 		exploratory analysis of data from a time series through techniques from Information Theory.
	With it, the user has a set of analysis techniques present in the literature to process and examine their data efficiently and with a 		minimum learning period.
	The tool is extensible and the system is web-based and developed in <i> R </i> using the <i> Shinny </i> web application framework.</p>

<h4 class="hline"> <a> Background </a> </h4>

  <div class="intro" id="iback"> 

	<p>The non-parametric analysis of time series helps to study the properties of the systems.
	Its application can be found in multiple areas of scientific knowledge such as, for example, the discrimination between stochastic and 		chaotic phenomena <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108004">Ravetti et al. (2014)</a>, 
	the identification of patterns of behavior in vehicular networks <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/e2015-60384-x">Aquino et al. (2015)</a>, 
	the classification and verification of <i> online </i> signatures <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166868">Rosso et al. (2016)</a>,
	the analysis of the informational efficiency of the oil market <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2952802">A. F. Bariviera & Rosso (2016)</a>,
	in the analysis of network robustness <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0375960115009275">Schieber et al. (2016)</a>, and
