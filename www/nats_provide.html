	<p>The NATS system was designed and developed in a modular way, composed of the following units:</p>

	<ul>
	<li> Symbolization module;</li>
	<li> Analysis module;</li>
	<li> Visualization and interaction module.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> The reading of CSV data is allowed, and the following user can choose:</p>

	<ul>
	<li> Generate time series plot;</li>
	<li> Calculate various entropy values;</li>
	<li> Calculate various values of stochastic distances;</li>
	<li> Calculate statistical complexities;</li>
	<li> Identify patterns in the time series plot;</li>
	<li> Generate pattern histogram;</li>
	<li> Identify the characteristic point of the series in the Entropy-Complexity plane;</li>
	<li> Identify the characteristic point of the series in the Fisher-Shannon plane;</li>
	</ul>

	<p>An original element of the system is the link between the pattern histogram, formed through the Bandt-Pompe symbolization process, 		and the time series.
	By choosing one or more elements of the histogram, the corresponding values in the time series are highlighted.
	This functionality allows visual analysis of the temporal distribution of the patterns, making it possible to perform other tests in the future.</p>
